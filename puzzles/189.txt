drought
a long dry spell with no rain at all
the ground cracks and the crops fail
wells go dry and streams shrink to naught
herds thin out when the grass dies
a state may ban the use of spare flow
the sky stays clear for weeks on end
pray for rain when one hits
the dust blows free on the bare land
a fire risk grows in the dry brush
it tests the grit of all who live on the land
