sleigh
a sled pulled by beasts through the snow
bells ring as it glides on the ice
a big man in red rides one once a year
the blades slide smooth on the packed white ground
hitch a team of deer to the front
a fur wrap keeps you warm in the back
it is the main ride for a cold land
the crack of a whip starts the team
a hill of snow makes a fast run for one
the chime of its bells means the cold feast is near
