wren
a small brown bird with a loud clear song
it darts through the hedge and the brush
for its size it sings with great force
it builds a snug round nest in a nook
its tail points up in a sharp tilt
it hops from branch to branch in search of bugs
the male sings to claim his patch
a house type lives near where you do
it is one of the most small birds you will see
a quick dart through the leaves and it is gone
