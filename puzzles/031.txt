cheese
milk gets thick and clumps to make this food
a wheel or block is how it comes
some kinds are sharp and some are mild
melt it on top of bread for a treat
a mouse is said to love it most
age it in a cave for months
one kind has holes all through it
a plate of it pairs well with wine
grate it fine on a bowl of soup
the best kinds come from far off lands
