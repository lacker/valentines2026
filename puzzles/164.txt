quartz
a hard clear stone found in the ground
it comes in shades of white pink and grey
a clock runs on a thin slice of it
veins of it run through rock like streaks
it is one of the most seen gems on earth
a chunk of it can have sharp bright points
sand is made of worn down bits of this
heat and stress in the earth form it
a split rock may hold sparks of it
new age shops sell chunks of it for luck
