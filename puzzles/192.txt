sheath
a case that holds a blade safe at your side
slide the edge in and it clicks shut
it guards the sharp part so you do not get cut
a belt loop holds one on your hip
pull it free when you need the tool
a long one fits a sword and a short one fits a small blade
it can be made of hide or hard cloth
the tip is closed so the point does not poke through
strap it on and your hands stay free
a fine one shows the craft of the one who made it
