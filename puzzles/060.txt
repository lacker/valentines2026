hill
a rise of land not quite a peak
roll down one in the thick green grass
a path winds up to the top of it
a fort or town may sit on one
a view from the top shows the land far off
sheep and goats graze on its slopes
a ridge of them runs through the land
it is not flat and not yet a mount
hike up one to get a good sweat
a sled slides fast down a white one
