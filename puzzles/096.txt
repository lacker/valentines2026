pride
a strong warm feel when you do well
hold your head high with this in your chest
too much of it can lead to a fall
a group of great cats is called this
show it when your team wins big
it can puff you up or drive you on
a flag stirs this for your home land
a job well done brings a rush of it
the sin of too much self love is this
choke it down when you must say you were wrong
