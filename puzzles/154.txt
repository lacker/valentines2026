vault
a strong locked room that holds your wealth
thick steel walls keep the goods safe
a bank has one deep in its base
spin the dial to crack the code
a pole and a leap takes you up and past the bar
a tomb built of stone may be called one
the roof arcs high in a grand hall
gold bars and gems sit stacked on shelves in one
a heist film shows the crew try to break in
it is the most safe place to store your things
