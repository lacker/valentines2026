flame
the bright hot tongue that leaps from a blaze
it licks at logs and turns them to ash
blue at the base and gold at the peak
a match struck right sparks one to life
moths are drawn to its warm glow
it leaps and sways in the draft
a lamp or torch burns with a small one
snuff it out with a quick puff of breath
it needs air and fuel to keep on
a wick feeds it till the wax runs out
