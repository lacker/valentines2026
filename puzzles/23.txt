bridge
cross it to get from one side to the next
it spans a gap or a stream
cars and trucks drive on its deck
steel or stone or wood holds it up
a troll hides in tales told of one
it links two banks of land
a drawl type lifts to let boats through
some hang from thick wire and sway
walk on foot to see the view from its rail
a town may be known for a great one
