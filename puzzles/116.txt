pitch
a thick black tar used to seal cracks
a throw from the mound to the plate
a slope of a roof can be steep or flat
the high or low of a sound is this
a field where a game of ball is played
dark as this means no light at all
coat the hull of a boat with it
a sales talk can be called one
tune the strings till the note hits the right one
a tent at a fair has a game of toss in it
