dusk
the sky dims as the day ends
it comes right at the edge of night
pink and gold paint the west sky
the sun dips down past the trees
the air cools and the light fades
bats come out at this dim hour
street lamps flick on one by one
a last glow hangs at the far edge
the stars start to peek through
it is the twin of dawn but at the end
