porch
a flat deck at the front of a house
sit on it and watch the world go by
a rail wraps round its edge
a chair or swing rests on its boards
a roof keeps the rain off your head
guests step up to it and knock
some are screened to keep the bugs out
sip a cold drink on a warm night here
plants in pots line its steps
the dog naps in the shade of it all day
