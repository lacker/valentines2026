grove
a small group of trees in one spot
walk through one and the shade keeps you cool
a peach or plum one yields fruit each year
the trunks stand in neat rows or a wild bunch
birds and deer find a home in one
the leaves form a roof of green
it is not as big as a full woods
a path winds through the soft light
a blessed one was a place of old rites
sit on the ground in one and find peace
