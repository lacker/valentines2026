key
turn it in a lock to get through
a small piece of shaped brass or steel
lose it and you are stuck out in the cold
each one fits just one lock
a ring holds a bunch of them
press one on a board to type a note
a clue to a code can be called this
the main point of a talk is the one
a sharp or flat can change the one in a song
a spare one hides by the front step
