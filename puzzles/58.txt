torch
hold it up to light the way in the dark
a flame burns at the top of a stick
in old times they hung on fort walls
the games start when one gets lit
pass it on from hand to hand
a rag soaked in oil burns at its tip
it casts a warm glow on the path
cave walls flick with its dim light
wind can blow it out if too strong
a march at night may use a row of them
