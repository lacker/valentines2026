stew
a thick warm dish of meat and greens
let it cook slow in a pot for hours
chunks of beef and roots fill the broth
it warms your bones on a cold night
a big spoon scoops it out for each bowl
the smell of it fills the whole house
toss in what you have and let it cook
bread goes well with a hot bowl of it
the stock gets rich as the hours pass
a crock pot is the best way to make one
