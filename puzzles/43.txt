crown
a king or queen wears one on their head
gold and gems line its round band
it sits on top as a sign of rule
take it off and the throne goes too
a prince waits long to get one
it gleams in the light of the court
some weigh so much they strain the neck
a jewel in its peak shines bright
guard it well in a locked case
to win one you must claim the throne
