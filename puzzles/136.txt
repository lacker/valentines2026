crane
a tall bird that wades in the still pools
a huge arm of steel that lifts loads high
it stands on one leg in the marsh
the kind on a build site swings beams through the air
a flock of the birds flies in a wide wedge
fold one from a square of thin sheets
its long neck bends in a smooth curve
the bird type bows and leaps to find a mate
a barge needs one to move the freight
a white one in the east means peace and long life
