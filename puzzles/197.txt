sleet
rain that turns to ice as it falls
it coats the road in a slick glaze
a storm of it stings your face like sand
it is not quite snow and not quite rain
drive slow when it hits or you will slide
it taps on the glass like small sharp stones
a grey sky dumps it for hours on end
salt and grit help melt it off the streets
it forms a thin crust on each branch and rail
the worst kind of storm to walk through at night
