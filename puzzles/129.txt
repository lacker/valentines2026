mule
a cross of a horse and a small grey beast
it hauls loads on rough steep trails
it is known to be quite a bull in its ways
its kick is strong so stand well back
a pack on its back holds your gear
it can go where a truck can not
its ears are long and its coat is brown
a mine once used them to pull the carts
it eats hay and oats and grass
sure of foot on the most thin ledge
