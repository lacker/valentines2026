house
you live in one with rooms and walls
a roof keeps out the rain and snow
a door lets you walk in and out
some are brick and some are wood
a yard or lawn sits out in front
meals get cooked in a warm room
a porch wraps round the front or back
paint the trim to keep it fresh
a key locks up your place at night
a home is what it feels like once you move in
