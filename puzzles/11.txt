wolf
it howls at the moon at night
a pack of them hunts as one
grey fur and sharp fangs mark this beast
it stalks through the woods with care
tales warn of one in a sheep guise
its eyes gleam in the dark
pups are born in a den each spring
it is kin to the tame dog
a lone one roams with no pack
some fear its cry in the wild
