spear
a long pole with a sharp point
throw it or thrust it at your mark
a hunt tool from the dawn of time
the tip is made of stone or steel
a shield and one go hand in hand
a fish can be caught with a jab of one
hold it firm and brace for the charge
a rank of them makes a wall of points
it flies straight and true when thrown
a brave one stands at the front with this
