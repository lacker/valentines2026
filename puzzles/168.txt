plaque
a flat plate on a wall with words cut in
it marks a spot where a thing took place
a doc may give you one for your work
a build may have one near the front door
the stuff that builds up on your teeth is called this
clean it off with a brush twice a day
brass or bronze are the most used types
it shows who or what or when
a hall of fame has rows and rows of them
a small one on a desk holds your name
