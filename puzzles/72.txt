gem
a rare bright stone of great worth
cut it well to make it flash
a ring or crown may hold one
some are red and some are blue or green
deep mines yield the rough raw form
a jewel is what most call one
it gleams and shines in the light
each kind has its own name and grade
a small one can cost a great deal
a gift of one shows deep love
