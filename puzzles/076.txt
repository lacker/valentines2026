ink
a dark wet stuff used for print and write
a pen holds it in a small tube
spill it and it stains for good
a squid squirts it to hide and flee
black is the most used shade
dip a quill in a well of it
words on a page are set down in this
it dries fast once on the sheet
a stamp pad is soaked full of it
a blot of it can wreck a clean page
