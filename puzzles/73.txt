root
it grows down in the dirt from a plant
it pulls up food and drink from the ground
yank one out and the plant will die
a tree has thick ones that spread wide
some kinds you can eat like a beet
the base or source of a thing is one
a math term for what squared gives you back
it grips the soil to hold the plant firm
they knot and twist as they age and grow
dig down and you will find a web of them
