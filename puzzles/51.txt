ghost
some say it haunts an old dark place
a soul that stays when the flesh is gone
white and pale it drifts through walls
a chill in the air means one is near
kids dress up as one at the end of fall
a sheet with holes is the cheap look
tales of them scare you late at night
a creak in the house may be from one
they moan and wail in old lore
you can see right through one they say
