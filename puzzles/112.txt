soap
rub it on your hands and it foams
it cleans the grime and grease right off
a bar of it sits by the sink
lye and fat are what the old kind took
a bath needs a good chunk of it
the suds rinse off in the stream
some smell of rose or mint
a pump on a jug squirts the kind that flows
wash up with it to kill the germs
kids hate it when it stings their eyes
