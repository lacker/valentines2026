moat
a deep trench of still dark flow round a fort
it keeps foes from the walls
a bridge that draws up spans it
fill it with marsh and muck
a knight must cross it to get in
some had sharp stakes at the base
it rings the whole keep in a loop
fish and eels swam in its depths
drain it and the fort stands bare
a tale of old times has one round the grounds
