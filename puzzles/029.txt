door
you push or pull it to walk through
a knob or latch is on its face
lock it to keep your home safe
a knock on it means guests are here
it swings on two or three hinged joints
wood or steel is what most are made of
close it to shut out the cold
some slide and some fold and some spin
a porch one leads to the front yard
it squeaks when it needs some oil
