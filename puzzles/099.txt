shade
it falls where the sun can not reach
a tree casts a cool patch of it
rest in it on a hot bright day
pull down a blind to make some
dark hues are called a deep one
a lamp puts out light but its base makes this
a ghost is an old name for one
a slight change in tone or sense is one
your eyes need it when the glare is strong
step out of the heat and find some
