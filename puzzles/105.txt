frog
it hops and leaps on strong back legs
a croak is the sound it makes at night
it starts life as a small thing with a tail
green skin and big round eyes mark it
a pond or marsh is where it lives
its tongue snaps out to catch a fly
some are bright hues to warn of harm
a prince in a tale was cursed as one
it can breathe through its damp skin
the rain brings them out in droves
