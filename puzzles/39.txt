tooth
it sits in your mouth in a row
brush it twice a day to keep it clean
a hole in one means a trip to the doc
the root goes deep in the gum
a sharp one in front helps you bite
the back ones grind up your food
kids lose them and new ones grow in
put one that falls out by your bed at night
white and hard with a coat that shines
a sweet treat can rot one if you are not good
