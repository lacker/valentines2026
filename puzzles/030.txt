snake
it slides on the ground with no legs
scales coat its long thin frame
some types have a bite that kills
a hiss warns you to stay back
it sheds its skin as it grows
coiled up it can strike real fast
a rat or mouse makes a fine meal
some folks keep a tame one as a pet
they bask in the sun to stay warm
a den of them curled up gives most a fright
