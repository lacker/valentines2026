shawl
a warm cloth draped on the back and arms
wrap it round you on a cool night
it has no sleeves just a wide flat piece
lace or wool or silk can form one
fold it in half and toss it on your back
an old dame in a tale oft wears one
a fringe hangs from its edge
it adds warmth when a coat is too much
pin it at the front with a brooch or clasp
drape it on a chair when you come in
