glimpse
a quick short look at a thing
you catch one as it goes by fast
it is not a long stare just a flash
a peek through a crack gives you one
the crowd parts and you get one of the stage
a brief one is all you need to know
turn your head and you might miss it
a cloud breaks and you get one of the moon
it leaves you with a want for more
a spy steals one through the blinds
