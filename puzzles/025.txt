glass
you can see right through it
a pane of it fills a frame in the wall
it breaks to sharp shards if struck
heat sand to a melt and it forms
a cup or jar is shaped from it
a lens of it helps you see far
it feels smooth and cool to the touch
a stain on it brings rich hues to light
a toast is raised with a full one
blow it hot to shape works of art
