whale
the most huge beast that swims the sea
it breathes air through a hole on top
a spout of mist shoots up when it comes up
its tail slaps the waves with great force
a calf stays near its mom for years
some sing long songs deep in the blue
a pod of them moves through the depths
oil from one lit lamps in the old days
a blue one is the most huge thing that lives
a breach sends its whole mass up in the air
