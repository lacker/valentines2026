ore
raw rock that holds bits of fine stuff
dig it up from deep in a mine
melt it down to get the good parts out
a vein of it runs through the stone
gold or steel starts as a lump of this
a cart hauls it up to the top
the more dense the good stuff the more it is worth
a forge needs a good batch of it
crush it first and then heat it up
the earth holds great stores of it down low
