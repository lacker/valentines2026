patch
a small piece sewn on to fix a tear
a plot of ground where things grow
put one on your eye to heal it up
a quilt is made of lots of these
a rough spot on a road needs one
a badge or mark sewn on a sleeve
a stretch of squash vines is called one
a fix for code can be called one too
stick one on and it hides the hole
the arm of an old coat gets one first
