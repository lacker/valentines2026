wine
grapes are pressed to make this drink
red or white are the main kinds
a cork seals the top of each one
pour a glass and raise a toast
it gets rich when aged for years
a vine grows the fruit that makes it
a cool dark room stores it down low
some of the best comes from far lands
swirl the glass and take a sniff
too much of it makes your head spin
