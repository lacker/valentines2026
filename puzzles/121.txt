trout
a fresh stream fish with spots on its side
cast a fly to lure one to bite
it leaps from the brook in a flash
cold clean creeks are where it lives
a pan fried one is a fine meal
the flesh is pink and rich in taste
it fights hard on the end of a line
a brown or brook type is most known
stock a lake with them each spring
wade in the stream to find the best ones
