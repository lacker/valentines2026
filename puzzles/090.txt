throne
a great chair where the one who rules sits
gold and gems may line its arms
a king or queen claims it as theirs
a high stepped stage holds it for all to see
wars are fought to take or keep it
a prince waits his whole life for it
it stands in a grand hall of stone
kneel in front of it to show your pledge
the crown goes with the seat of might
lose it and you lose all you hold
