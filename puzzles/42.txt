pearl
it forms in a shell in the sea
a grain of grit starts it off
white and round and smooth with a glow
a strand of them hangs from the neck
rare ones fetch a high price
a clam builds one coat by coat
it has a soft sheen not a sharp flash
those who dive plunge deep to find them
a gift of these shows love and class
some come in shades of pink or black
