cloak
a long loose wrap draped on your back
it hides what you wear and who you are
a hood on top can shade your face
dark cloth works best if you must sneak
a knight or king might don one
clasp it at the throat to hold it on
it swings and flows as you stride
rain rolls off a thick waxed one
a cape is much the same as this
pull it tight to block the cold wind
