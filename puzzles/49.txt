bear
it roams the woods on all fours
thick brown or black fur coats its frame
it stands tall when it wants to look round
fish from the stream are its prime catch
a den is where it sleeps through the cold
cubs stay close to their mom for months
claws on its paws can tear through bark
do not get near one in the wild
a growl means it feels a threat
some types live where ice and snow rule
