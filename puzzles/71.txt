raft
logs or planks lashed tight to float
ride one down a rough stream
it rocks and tilts on the waves
no hull or deck just a flat base
pump it up if it is the blow up kind
grip the sides when the ride gets wild
a pole or oar steers it through
strand on an isle and build one to leave
it is the most bare form of a boat
tie it to the dock when you reach shore
