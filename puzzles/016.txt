fish
it swims in the sea or a lake
scales coat its sleek wet skin
gills let it breathe down in the deep
cast a line and hook to catch one
a trout or bass or cod is one
it flips and flops when pulled from the stream
some live in schools of a great size
a tank of glass can hold a pet one
chefs serve it raw as a fine dish
its fins help it glide through the waves
