hedge
a row of thick green shrubs that forms a wall
trim it flat on top with big shears
it marks where your land ends
a bird may nest deep in its base
it grows thick and blocks the view
a maze can be built from tall rows of one
it can mean to play it safe and not risk all
a gate in it lets you walk through
the leaves turn brown if you do not tend it
a low one lines the path to the front door
