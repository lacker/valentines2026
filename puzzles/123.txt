wand
a thin stick used to cast a spell
wave it and say the words
a witch or sage holds one in hand
a spark or flash comes from its tip
it is made of wood or bone
a tale of a boy with one on his brow
tap it on a hat and a hare pops out
the one who wields it has great might
some are long and some are short
a gift of one means trust and skill
