lens
a curved piece of glass that bends light
look through one and things seem close or far
a scope or pair of specs holds one
a doc shines a light through one to check your eyes
the one in your eye helps you see
a cam has one at the front to catch the scene
some are thick and some are thin
it can zoom in on things far off
a crack in one blurs the whole view
clean it with a soft cloth so it stays clear
