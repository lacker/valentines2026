sponge
a soft thing full of holes that soaks up wet
squeeze it out and use it to scrub
the sea has ones that grow on the reef
a bath one sits by the tub
it puffs back to its shape when you let go
a cake type is light and full of air
it cleans the grime off a dish or a top
one of these can hold a lot of its weight in drink
wring it dry and start once more
a dried sea one feels rough in your hand
