tide
the sea moves in and out by its pull
the moon has the force that drives it
high and low it shifts twice a day
pools form in the rocks when it goes out
boats rest on the sand at the low point
a strong one can drag you far out
it shapes the shore as the years pass
the surf rolls in as it comes up
a red one means too much growth in the sea
time and this wait for no one
