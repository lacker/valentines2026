stove
cook your meals on its hot flat top
a flame or coil heats it up
a pot or pan sits on its grate
the range in a house is one of these
turn the knob to set the heat
a bake box sits in the base of most
it warms a cold room in the north
wood or gas or charge can fuel it
a pot of soup steams on top of it
keep kids back from its hot face
