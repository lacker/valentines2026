plank
a long flat board of cut wood
walk on one that spans a gap
a ship deck is made of rows of them
a rogue at sea makes you walk one off the side
nail them down to make a floor
a bench or shelf can be just one of these
a thick one holds a lot of weight
sand it smooth and coat it with stain
it bows a bit in the damp air
stack them high in the yard to dry
