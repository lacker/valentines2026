scarf
a long strip of cloth worn round the neck
knit one from warm wool for the cold months
it keeps the chill wind off your throat
wrap it once or twice and tuck the ends in
a silk one adds style to a plain dress
hang it on a hook by the door
red or blue or striped they come in all sorts
pull it tight when the frost bites hard
a gift of one shows you thought of their warmth
the fringe at each end sways when you walk
