moss
a soft green growth that clings to rock and bark
it spreads in damp and shade
no roots or stems just a thick mat
it feels like a plush pad to the touch
it thrives where the sun does not reach
a north face of a tree may wear it
a stone wall turns green with it in time
a bog is full of this thick sponge
it soaks up rain like a cloth
a log left long in the woods gets a coat of it
