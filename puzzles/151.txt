scar
a mark left on the skin from a wound
the cut heals but this stays
it fades in time but does not go
a deep one tells a tale of pain
land can have one from a fire or a dig
it can make you feel shy or proud
a stitch leaves a thin one on the skin
touch it and the feel is smooth and tight
a tree can have one where a branch broke off
some wear theirs like a badge of strength
