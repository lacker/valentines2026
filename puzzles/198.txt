swan
a large white bird that glides on a lake
its long curved neck bends like a smooth arc
it pairs with one mate for its whole life
the young ones are grey and turn white in time
it can hiss and bite if you come too close
a tale says it sings once right at the end
its grace on the waves is a fine sight
the queen of the land owns all wild ones
it tucks its head back when it sleeps
a flock of them drifts like clouds on the pond
