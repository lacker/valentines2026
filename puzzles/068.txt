clay
a soft earth you can shape with your hands
wet it down and mold it on a wheel
bake it in a kiln and it turns hard
pots and bowls are formed from this
red or brown or grey it can be
kids play with a bright store bought kind
a brick is just a block of it
it sticks to your boots in the rain
the ground has a thick bed of it
sculpt a face or form from a lump
