snow
white flakes fall from the sky
it blanks the ground in cold months
kids build men out of it
a big storm brings lots of this
ski slopes need a good base of it
plows clear the roads when it piles up
each flake has six points they say
it melts when spring warmth comes
a drift of it can block your door
catch one on your tongue for fun
