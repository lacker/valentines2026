song
you sing one with your voice
notes and words make up its parts
a tune you hum when you feel glad
a group sings one in church
a hit one plays on the charts
write the words and set them to a beat
some are slow and some are fast
a band plays one on a stage
it can make you laugh or cry
stuck in your head all day long
