nest
a bird builds one from twigs and grass
eggs sit safe in its round cup
high up in a tree is where most go
a hawk or wren weaves one each spring
lined with soft bits for the young
a wasp makes one from chewed up wood
leave it be or the birds will flee
a bald one sits up on a cliff ledge
a snug warm spot is called one too
hatch day comes and the chicks peep out
