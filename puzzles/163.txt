flask
a small flat jar that fits in your coat
take a sip from one on a cold hike
the cap screws on to stop a spill
steel or glass can form its shell
it holds just a few sips of drink
slip one in your hip or chest fold
a lab has a round glass one on the bench
warm your hands and your gut with what is in it
a curved shape lets it rest on your thigh
fill it up and stash it for the road
