chain
links of steel hooked end to end
it wraps round a gate to keep it shut
a lock hangs from a loop of it
a bike has one that drives the wheel
drag one and it scrapes on the ground
a gold one hangs round the neck
strength comes from each link that holds
break one link and the whole thing fails
each link joins the next in a long line
pull on it to raise the weight
