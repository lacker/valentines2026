cloud
it floats high up in the sky
white and grey and soft to the eye
rain falls from the dark kind
the sun hides when they crowd the sky
a plane flies through them on the way up
they change shape as the wind moves them
fog is one that sits on the ground
a wisp of one drifts by at dawn
some stack tall and bring a storm
on a clear day there are none
