surge
a strong rush that moves fast and hard
the sea makes one in a big storm
a crowd can do one and push through a gate
the force of it sweeps all in its path
it comes on quick and fades just as fast
a bolt of charge through a wire is one
hold firm or it will knock you down flat
the tide makes one twice each day
the troops made one at the front lines
a wave of it can flood the whole coast
