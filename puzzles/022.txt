wind
it blows and makes the trees sway
a gust can knock your hat right off
kites soar high when it is strong
sails catch it to move a boat
a breeze is a soft form of it
a gale can rip roofs off a home
vanes spin on a hill to make charge
it can howl through a crack at night
dust swirls up when it sweeps the plains
a calm day has none at all
