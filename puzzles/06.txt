tree
it grows tall with roots in the ground
leaves sprout on its limbs in spring
birds build nests up in its boughs
the trunk is wrapped in rough bark
some types lose their leaves each fall
chop one down to get good wood
an oak or elm or pine is one
shade from it feels nice on hot days
sap runs through it like blood
rings in the trunk show how old it is
