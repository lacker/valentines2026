quench
to put out a fire or a thirst
drink deep and your need for it stops
a cold glass of drink does this on a hot day
douse a flame and this is what you do
cool hot steel in a tank and this is the word
the fire crew works to do this to a blaze
it means to end or kill a want or need
naught but a long cold drink will do this
the urge to drink stops once you have done this
a deep well of spring flow can do this for a town
