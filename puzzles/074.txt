bark
the rough skin on the trunk of a tree
peel it off and you see the wood
a dog makes this sharp loud sound
birch has a thin white kind you can strip
it shields the tree from bugs and cold
some kinds can be brewed as a tea
thick and cracked on an old oak
a fierce one warns you to stay back
it comes in shades of brown and grey
both a tree part and a noise a hound makes
