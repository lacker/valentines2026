mast
a tall pole that stands up on a ship
sails hang from its cross beams
the flag flies at the top of one
a perch up high on it lets you see far
it groans and sways in the storm winds
ropes and lines run up and down it
the main one is the most tall
a snap in a gale means the ship is in dire straits
wood or steel can form its shaft
look for land from the top of one
