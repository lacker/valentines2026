rain
wet drops fall from clouds in the sky
a storm can make the streets all slick
it helps the grass and plants to grow
grey skies and wind come with a pour
you need a coat to stay dry
splash through the mud it leaves
roofs drip when it comes down hard
fields and crops need it to thrive
it can drench you head to toe
a light mist or a wild pour
