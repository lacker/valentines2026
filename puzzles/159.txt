grape
a small round fruit that grows on a vine
squash them down and the juice makes wine
green or red or deep dark blue
pick a bunch from the stem and eat them fresh
they grow in rows on a sun drenched slope
dry them out and they shrink to small sweet bits
a jam or spread can be made from the juice
they come in tight packed groups on the stem
a glass of their juice is sweet and cold
some say the best ones come from old vines
