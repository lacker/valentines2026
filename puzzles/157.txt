lodge
a small house built in the woods
stay in one on a ski trip
a warm fire burns in the big stone hearth
the roof has a steep pitch to shed the snow
thick logs form the walls and the frame
a group or club may meet in one
it sits by a lake or at the foot of the hills
hang your coat and warm your hands
a grand one has rooms for a crowd
a hunt or fish trip starts from one
