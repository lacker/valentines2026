dream
you have one when you sleep at night
some are good and some are bad
your mind makes scenes that feel quite real
you might fly or fall or float
when you wake it fades from thought
a goal you hope for can be one
close your eyes and drift to this
the brain does strange things in deep sleep
some folks write down what they saw
chase the ones that drive your heart
