quilt
a warm thick cloth for your bed
squares of print are stitched in rows
a group of friends may sew one as a team
tuck it round you on a cold night
some are passed down through the years
each patch tells a small tale
thread and cloth and care go in
it sits on top of the sheets
bright hues make a bold one stand out
fold it at the foot of the bed by day
