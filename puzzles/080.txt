fence
it runs round a yard to mark the edge
posts and rails make up its frame
a gate lets you pass through it
paint it white for a clean look
it keeps the dog in and keeps guests out
wood or wire or chain link forms one
a good one makes a good friend next door
lean on it and chat with the folks next door
mend the parts that sag or rot
a hedge is a green form of one
