hawk
a bird of prey with keen sharp eyes
it soars high and scans the ground
a dive from the sky takes its catch
its claws grip the mouse in a flash
a screech from on high is its call
it rests on a branch and waits
some are trained to hunt for sport
brown and grey plumes line its wings
it rides the warm air in wide loops
a field mouse fears the shade of one
