elm
a tall tree with a broad spread of limbs
its leaves turn gold in the fall
a blight wiped out most of them long back
the bark is rough and dark with deep lines
it once lined the streets of old towns
its shade cools a whole yard
the wood is tough and hard to split
plant a new one to bring them back
its boughs arch up high and wide
a park bench sits well in the shade of one
