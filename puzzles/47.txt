lake
a large pool of fresh still blue
trees line its calm smooth shore
boats drift on its flat glass top
a dock juts out from the bank
cast a line to catch a trout
loons call out at dusk on it
ice may form on it in the cold months
swim out to the raft when it warms up
a mist sits low on it at dawn
the hills or woods wrap round its edge
