dew
small drops of wet that form at night
it sits on the grass at first light
the air cools and this shows up
wipe it off your shoes as you walk
a web strung with it gleams in the dawn
it fades as the sun climbs high
a cool clear morn brings the most of it
plants drink it up through their leaves
your car hood is damp with it at dawn
a lawn thick with it soaks your feet
