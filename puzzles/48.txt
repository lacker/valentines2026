owl
it hunts at night with big round eyes
a hoot from the dark woods is its call
it sits on a branch and scans the ground
soft plumes let it fly with no sound
it turns its head near all the way round
a mouse or rat makes a fine meal
a barn type has a white face like a disc
wise is what most say this bird is
it sleeps through the day in a hole
sharp claws grip its prey with a fierce hold
