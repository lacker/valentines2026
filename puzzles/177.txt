feast
a grand meal spread out on a long desk
friends and kin come from far to eat
the board groans with roast meat and bread
a toast is raised at the start of one
a fall or cold time one marks the year
eat till your belt feels tight
a whole bird sits at the heart of it
wine and song flow free at the best ones
a king once held one that went on for days
clear the plates and you still feel full
