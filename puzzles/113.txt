thread
a thin long strand used to sew
a sharp thin point pulls it through the cloth
tie a knot at the end so it stays
a spool holds a coil of it
pick a hue that goes with the cloth
it can snap if pulled too hard
stitch by stitch it binds the seams
it feeds through a small eye at the tip
silk or fleece can be spun to this
a loose one means the whole thing could come free
