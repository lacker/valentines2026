blood
it flows through veins in your whole frame
red and warm and thick like paint
a cut or wound makes it seep out
the heart pumps it all day long
give some at a drive to help the sick
cells in it fight off germs
it brings air to all your parts
a test of it can show your health
ties of kin are called bonds of this
the sight of it makes some feel faint
