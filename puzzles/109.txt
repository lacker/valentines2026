claw
a sharp curved nail on a paw or foot
a cat has them and so does a hawk
it digs and grips and tears with ease
a crab has a large pinch type
trim them on a pet so they stay blunt
they click on a hard wood floor
a scratch from one can draw red lines
a bear swipes with a huge set of them
they pull back in on a cat at rest
a trap or vice can be called one too
