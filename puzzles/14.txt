sword
a blade of steel used in old wars
knights would wield one in each fight
its edge is sharp and can cut deep
a hilt wraps round the grip you hold
it rests in a sheath at your side
forge one from hot ore and flame
two foes would clash with one in each hand
some are long and some are short
a smith pounds and shapes the steel
tales speak of a great one in a stone
