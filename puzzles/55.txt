wall
it stands up straight to block your path
brick or stone or wood can form one
a room has four of them most times
hang art or a frame on its flat face
paint it a new shade to change the feel
a fence is a low form of one
a great one in the east took years to build
it holds up the roof and keeps out the cold
lean on it when your legs feel weak
break through one and you find what hides
