chalk
a soft white stick used to write and draw
kids use it on a board at school
it leaves dust on your hands and clothes
a line of it marks where to start
rub it on your palms to get a grip
it comes in bright hues for art on walks
wipe it off with a damp cloth
a screech on the board makes you cringe
it breaks if you press too hard
a good rain clears it off the ground
