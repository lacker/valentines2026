soot
a black dust left by fire and smoke
it coats the flue and the stones round the hearth
wipe it off and your hands turn dark
it stains the air in old mill towns
breathe it in and your lungs go bad
a sweep cleans it from the stack
it builds up thick if you do not clean
the smell of it clings to brick and stone
a fire that burns cool leaves more of it
rain streaks it down the side of a wall
