crust
the hard thin shell on the edge of bread
bake it long and it turns dark and crisp
the earth has one on its top like a skin
a pie has one on the base and on top
break through it to reach the soft part
kids pick it off and leave it on the plate
a fresh loaf has a warm one that cracks
roll the dough flat and press it in the pan
a thick one holds the fill of a pot pie
a sheet of ice or snow forms one on top
