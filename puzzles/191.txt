gust
a sharp quick burst of strong wind
it hits you hard and then it fades
hold your hat or it blows right off
a door slams shut from one
leaves spin up in a wild swirl
it can knock you off your stride
a kite jerks up when one comes through
the flag snaps straight when one blows
a calm day breaks when one rolls in
dust and trash fly in its brief rush
