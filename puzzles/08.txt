horse
ride on its back through fields and trails
it runs fast with a strong stride
a mane flows from its long neck
hooves pound the dirt when it runs
feed it hay and oats each day
a barn or stall is where it sleeps
some pull carts and some race on tracks
a foal is a young one of these
brush its coat to keep it clean
a ranch is where you might find one
