scent
a smell that floats through the air
a rose gives off a sweet one
spray some on your wrist and neck
a hound can track a trail by this
some are strong and some are faint
a pine woods has a sharp fresh one
it can bring back an old thought in a flash
a shop sells small glass jars of it
a skunk lets loose a foul one
the nose picks up each kind with ease
