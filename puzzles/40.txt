ring
slide it on a hand and it wraps round
gold or gems may grace its band
a bride and groom swap them at the vow
a phone makes the sound of one
a box holds the one you give
a round shape like a hoop or loop
a bell has one when it sounds
a tree trunk shows these if you count
step in the one at a fight match
a key one holds all your keys
