pelt
the skin and fur stripped from a beast
a fur man dries one on a frame
it keeps you warm as a coat or rug
trade in them built the north lands long back
tan it and it turns to a soft hide
a mink or fox gives a fine one
rain or stones can strike you in a hard one
stack them up and sell at the post
the fur side feels thick and warm
stretch it flat and scrape it clean
