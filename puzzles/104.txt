plum
a soft round fruit with dark smooth skin
bite in and the flesh is sweet and tart
a pit sits hard in the core
it grows on a small short tree
dry one out and it turns to a prune
a jam or pie can be made from it
its juice stains your hands and lips
it comes in shades of red and blue
pick them in the late warm months
a ripe one feels soft when you press
