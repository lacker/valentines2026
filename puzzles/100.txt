skull
the round hard case that holds your brain
it sits on top of your spine
a grin with no lips is its look
a flag with crossed bones shows one
it guards the most key part of you
a nurse can see through it with a scan
a crack in it is a grave wound
a mask of it scares on dark nights
the jaw hangs from its base
all that is left of a head in the end
