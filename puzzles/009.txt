gold
it shines bright and has great worth
coins and rings are made from it
a soft dense ore that bends with ease
dig deep in mines to find a vein
the rush out west drew crowds in droves
a crown or chain might be made of it
its hue is like the sun at dawn
it does not rust or lose its gleam
a bar of it weighs quite a lot
some say a pot of it hides past the arc
