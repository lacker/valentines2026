grasp
to hold or grip a thing in your hand
reach out and take a firm one
a strong one keeps you from a fall
a child wraps small hands in a tight one
it can mean to see the point of a thought
let go and your hold on it breaks
squeeze hard and the hold grows more firm
a branch in a storm needs a good one
it is what you do when you catch a thrown ball
a weak one means the thing may slip free
