rope
a long twist of thick cord or twine
tie a knot to hold things fast
a noose is a loop at the end
those who climb use one on a cliff
pull on it in a tug of war
loop one and throw to catch a steer
ships are moored to docks with one
skip through one for a fun game
it wears and snaps if stretched too thin
coil it up when you are done
