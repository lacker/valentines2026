ledge
a thin flat strip that juts from a wall
stand on one and look down at the drop
a bird may rest on one high up
a shelf of rock on the side of a cliff
put a plant or a cup on one by the pane
a cat likes to sit on one and watch
the edge of it is where things can slip off
a climb path may use one as a step
snow piles on one in the cold months
a slim one takes great care to cross
