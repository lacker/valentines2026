lance
a long pole with a sharp point at the end
a knight on a horse would charge with one
joust with it and try to knock your foe off
it thrusts straight at a shield or chest
a brave deed in old tales used one
a doc may use one to drain a sore
the tip is made of steel or bronze
hold it firm with both hands as you ride
a rank of troops would point them at the foe
it is like a spear but used from horse back
