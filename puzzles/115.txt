bowl
a round dish that curves up at the sides
pour soup or stew in one to eat
it sits flat on the desk and holds things
a lane game knocks down pins with a big ball
mix dough or eggs in a large one
a dog laps from one on the floor
a rice or grain dish fills one up
stack them in the rack once clean
some are made of wood and some of clay
a chip in the rim means time for a new one
