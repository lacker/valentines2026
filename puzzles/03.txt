bread
you bake it with flour and yeast
a loaf of it sits on the shelf
toast a slice for a quick meal
dough must rise and then get shaped
the crust on top turns gold and crisp
knead it well so it feels soft
wheat and grain go in the mix
spread some jam on a warm piece
it can be white or dark rye
a fresh one smells so good
