scroll
a roll of old text wound round two rods
the words are set down in neat lines
a scribe wrote on one with a quill
it curls up when you let go of the ends
keep it in a dry case to last
the law or a creed was kept on one
a seal in wax stamps it as real
it is how books looked in the old world
pull it flat to read what it says
a chest in a vault may hold a rare one
