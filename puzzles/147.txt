wreath
a ring of green boughs hung on the door
it marks the start of the cold time feast
twine and wire hold the green bits in a round
a bow of red cloth sits on top
some add small lights or dried fruit
a fresh pine one smells like the woods
it hangs from a hook or a nail
a grave may get one to show you care
it can be made of dried blooms or vines
take it down when the new year comes
