creek
a small thin stream that winds through the woods
step on stones to cross it dry
kids wade in and splash on hot days
it feeds a big stream down the way
the sound of it is a soft low hum
trout may hide in the pools by the bend
its banks are lined with moss and ferns
it dries to just a drip in the drought
a bridge of logs spans it at the trail
rain swells it to a rush in the spring
