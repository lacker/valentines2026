wax
bees make this stuff in the hive
melt it and pour it to shape
a stick of it burns with a wick and flame
rub some on a board to make it slick
it seals a note with a stamped mark
the moon does this when it grows full
it drips slow like thick warm tears
a coat of it makes wood shine bright
buff a car with it for a smooth gleam
it goes soft in the heat of the day
