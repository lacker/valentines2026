scarce
not much of it can be found
when the well runs dry this is what things get
a drought makes food and drink this way
a rare gem or coin is called this
in hard times most goods are this
the less there is the more it costs
a cold snap makes fresh fruit this
hunt far and wide for what is this
it means you had best save what you have
the word means hard to find or get
