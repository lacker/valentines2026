sea
waves crash and roll on its vast blue face
salt fills the air near its shore
boats sail far out on its wide stretch
deep down strange life swells in the dark
tides rise and fall twice a day
a beach is where the land meets it
storms churn its top to a wild froth
shells wash up from its floor
whales and sharks swim through its depths
it spans most of the globe we call earth
