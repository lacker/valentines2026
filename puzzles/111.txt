brick
a block of baked clay used to build
stack them in rows with paste in the gaps
a house or wall is made from these
red is the most seen hue
it holds up well in heat and cold
a path or walk can be laid with them
old towns have streets paved in them
it weighs quite a bit for its size
a kiln fires the raw earth to make one
a chip in one shows the age of the build
