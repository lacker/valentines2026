clam
a shell fish that lives in the sand
dig for them at the beach when the tide goes out
the two halves of its shell snap shut
steam them in a pot and they pop wide
a thick soup made of them warms the gut
it sits still on the sea floor and waits
pry one with a blade to eat it raw
it can mean to go mute and say naught
a pearl can form in the rare kind
the brine of the sea gives them their taste
