snare
a trap set to catch a beast
a loop of wire laid on the ground
step in one and it pulls tight
a drum type has wires stretched on the base
the sharp snap of one marks the beat
set one on a trail where game runs
it is a trick or a lure that draws you in
the more you fight the more it grips
a fox or hare may find one in the brush
free your foot with care or it cuts deep
