moon
it glows in the dark night sky
round and pale and full of light
the tides rise and fall by its pull
it wanes and then it comes back full
stars shine next to it at night
wolves are said to howl at it
a thin bright arc or a wide disc
you can see it from the earth
it loops round our world once a month
some nights it hides and goes all dark
