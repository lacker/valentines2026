reed
a tall thin plant that grows in wet ground
it sways in the breeze by the shore
a mat or roof can be built from it
blow through one and it makes a tone
a band horn has one in its mouth piece
the marsh is thick with rows of them
it bends but does not break in the wind
birds hide their nests in a stand of them
the sound of one is warm and smooth
cut one down and the core is bare
