oak
a large strong tree that lives for years
its leaves have a curved lobed edge
the wood from it is hard and dense
a small round nut falls from its boughs
build a ship or desk from its planks
its bark is thick and dark and cracked
it stands wide and tall in a field
a grove of them shades the ground
some say it is a sign of strength
its roots go deep and hold the earth
