ash
it is what stays when a blaze dies out
grey and soft and light as dust
tap a smoke and it falls off the tip
a tray on the desk holds the bits
the hearth fills with it by the end
a tree of this name has pale bark
spread it on fields to help plants grow
a cloud of it can block the sun
the wind blows it in swirls from the pit
brush it off your coat and move on
