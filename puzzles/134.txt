moose
a huge beast of the north woods
a bull one grows wide flat horns each year
it wades through a lake to eat the plants
its legs are long and thin for its bulk
a cow one calls out in the fall
it stands more tall than a horse or elk
the fur is dark brown and coarse
do not get too close or it may charge
its tracks are large and deep in the mud
a lodge by the lake may have one on the wall
