coal
a black rock that burns hot
dig it from deep in a mine
it drove the trains of the past
a lump of it glows red in the grate
toss one more on to keep the heat up
a stove can run on a pile of it
it leaves ash and soot when spent
the smoke from it stains the air grey
a bad kid gets one for the big day
it formed from old plants pressed down for years
