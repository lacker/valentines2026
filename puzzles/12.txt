storm
dark clouds roll in and winds pick up
rain pounds down and bolts of light flash
trees bend and sway in the strong gusts
a calm comes once it has passed
hail can fall in the worst of these
the sky turns black in the day
seek safe ground when one hits
a surge of waves can flood the coast
loud booms of sound shake the walls
check the news to see if one draws near
