knife
a sharp blade used to cut and slice
it sits in a block on the bench
spread jam or cream cheese with a dull one
a chef keeps one keen with a whet stone
fold one up to fit in your pack
the edge must stay sharp to work well
a steak one has small teeth on its side
chop herbs and greens with a broad one
a sheath keeps the blade safe when stored
it is one of the first tools man made
