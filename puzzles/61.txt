frost
a thin white coat of ice on things
it forms at night when the air gets cold
scrape it off your car at dawn
it kills the last plants of the fall
grass snaps and cracks with it at dawn
a pane of glass shows its lace like shapes
the ground goes hard when it sets in
breath turns to mist in this kind of cold
it melts as soon as the sun comes up
a late one in spring can wreck the crops
