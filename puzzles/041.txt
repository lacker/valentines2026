wheel
it turns round and round on a shaft
a car has four of them to roll
a spoke runs from the hub to the rim
steer with the one in your hands
the first ones were made of wood and stone
a spin of it sets things in play
a cart or truck needs these to move
a flat one means you pull off the road
grease the parts so it rolls smooth
round and round it goes all day
