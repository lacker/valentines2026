pier
a long flat deck that juts out from the shore
walk to the end and look at the sea
a boat ties up at its side
fish from the edge with a pole and a line
thick posts hold it up out of the waves
a plank walk leads you past the surf
a fair or shops may line its length
the wood gets grey and worn from the salt air
a storm can rip parts of it free
sit on the edge and let your legs hang down
