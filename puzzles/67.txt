vine
it climbs up a wall or a fence
grapes grow in a row of them
green leaves spread and twist as it grows
it wraps round a post or a tree
a thick one can hang from a branch
wine starts in the fields where these grow
it needs sun and rain to thrive
trim it back or it takes all the space
some types bloom with small bright buds
a wood frame gives it a place to hold
