dawn
the sky glows pink just as the day starts
the sun peeks up past the edge of the earth
birds wake and sing at this hour
dew sits fresh on the grass and leaves
it comes right at the end of night
a cock crows loud to mark its start
mist hangs low as the light grows
the air feels cool and crisp and still
rise with it to make the most of the day
it paints the clouds in shades of rose
