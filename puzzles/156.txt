bluff
a tall steep bank by a stream or sea
it can mean to fake a strong hand
a bold lie meant to scare your foe
call one and see if the claim is real
a cliff face that drops to the plains
a game of cards rests on a good one
stand on one and watch the boats go by
a sharp mind sees through a weak one
keep a straight face to pull one off
a ridge of earth at the bend of a stream
