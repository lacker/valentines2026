clasp
a small clip that holds two parts shut
snap it on a chain or a strap
a belt or bag has one at the front
press it and the two sides lock
it can be made of brass or steel
a hand shake is a warm one of hands
a pearl strand links at the back with one
it clicks when it shuts and pops when it springs
a brooch has one on the back to pin it on
a firm one holds a thing safe and close
