paste
a thick wet mix used to stick things
spread it on the back and press down
a tube of it sits on the shelf
flour and drink make a rough kind
gems and stones that are not real are called this
a jar of it and a brush is all you need
it dries hard once the air hits it
kids use it in art class to glue
a wall can be hung with this as a base
rub some on your teeth to clean them twice a day
