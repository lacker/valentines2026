wrench
a tool that grips and turns a bolt
a twist of it sets the nut loose or tight
a set of them hangs on a peg in the shop
the jaw of it clamps down on steel
a pipe one has long jaws for round things
a hard pull or twist of the arm is one
it takes the right size for each bolt
turn it the wrong way and you strip the thread
a tool box has a few of these at least
the grunt of force as you push on one says the bolt is stuck
