cage
bars of wire or steel box in the space
a bird or beast is kept in one
lock the gate and the thing stays put
a zoo has rows and rows of them
some are small for a mouse or a finch
a trapped thing stalks and waits
the door swings wide to set one free
a rib one guards your lungs and heart
a fight match takes place in one
shake the bars and the whole thing rings
