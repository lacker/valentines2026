stone
a hard rock you find on the ground
walls and paths are built from it
skip one on a lake and watch it bounce
it does not bend or break with ease
old forts were made of stacked ones
a gem is a rare and prized one
it sinks fast when tossed in a pond
moss can grow on its damp side
some are smooth and some are rough
a cairn is a pile of these
