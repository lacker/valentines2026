mask
you wear it on your face to hide
a slit for the eyes lets you see
some are worn at a grand ball
a doc puts one on in the ward
it can scare or thrill or make you laugh
paint one bright for a stage show
a thief might use one to hide
peel it off to show who you are
some are carved from wood or clay
the one you show the world may not be real
