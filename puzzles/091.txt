path
a strip of flat ground you walk on
it winds through the woods or fields
feet wear it down as the years pass
a trail or track is the same thing
it leads from one place to the next
a fork in it means you must choose
stones or dirt make up its bed
a sign may point you the right way
the short one gets you there quick
stay on it or you may get lost
