sleeve
the part of a shirt that wraps your arm
roll it up when the work gets hot
a long one runs down to your wrist
a short one ends near the top of your arm
hide a card up one for a trick
a tear in it shows skin through the cloth
it may be tight or loose in its fit
a cuff folds at the end of one
ink or sauce stains one at a meal
pull it down when the air gets cold
