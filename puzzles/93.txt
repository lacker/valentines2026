dust
fine dry bits that float in the air
it lands on shelves when no one cleans
a ray of sun shows it drift and swirl
wipe it off with a soft damp cloth
a cloud of it kicks up from dry ground
old books and rooms fill up with it
sneeze when too much gets in your nose
it is what all things turn to in the end
a storm of it can black out the sky
sweep the floor and it piles in the pan
