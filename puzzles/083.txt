harp
pluck its strings and a soft tone rings out
a tall frame of wood holds rows of wire
it sits on a stage or in a hall
a hand sweeps the strings in a broad arc
the sound feels like a dream or spell
it has more strings than most play at once
old tales say those in the sky play one
a small one fits in your two hands
its shape curves like a wing or wave
a bard or muse would strum one long back
