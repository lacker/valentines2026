barge
a flat wide boat used to haul goods
it moves slow on a still smooth stream
no sails just a tug that pulls it
coal or grain fills its deep low hull
it rides low in the drink when full
a lock lets it go up or down the route
a horn blasts as it comes through
the crew steers with a long pole or wheel
it can block a whole lane of the stream
a dock crane loads it from the shore
