oath
a vow you make and swear to keep
raise your hand and say the words
a judge asks you to take one in court
break it and you lose all trust
a knight once knelt to make one to his lord
the words bind you to what you said
some are sealed with a clasp of hands
a pledge to serve your land is one
it is as strong as the one who speaks it
truth must hold or the whole thing falls
