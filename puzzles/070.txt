swamp
a wet low land full of muck
trees with wide roots grow in the still pools
frogs croak and bugs swarm in the air
the ground sinks as you walk through
moss hangs from the limbs like drapes
large beasts lurk in the dark still depths
the air is thick and hot and damp
reeds and grass choke the edge
it smells of rot and old wet leaves
wade through it and the mud grabs your boots
