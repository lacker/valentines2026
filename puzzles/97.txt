grain
a small hard seed from wheat or rice
fields of it wave in the wind
grind it to make flour for bread
a sack of it feeds a whole town
plant it in spring and reap it in fall
one small piece of sand is called this too
the lines in wood run with its flow
a bin or shed stores it dry
it has fed the world since the first farms
thresh and sort it at the end of the year
