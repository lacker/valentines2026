ridge
a long thin line of high ground
it runs like a spine through the hills
hike on top of one and see both sides
the peak of a roof makes one
a range of them runs on for miles
wind blows hard on its bare crest
snow may cap the one up north
a trail runs the length of its back
the sun hits one side first at dawn
a plowed field shows rows of these in the dirt
