reef
a ridge of rock or shell just down in the sea
bright fish swim through its nooks and gaps
a ship can run on one and crack its hull
warm clear seas have the best ones
the small beasts that build it grow slow
a mask and tube lets you see one from the top
it shields the shore from the worst of the waves
a bleach of one turns it white and dead
dive down and the hues take your breath
guard it well or the whole chain of life fails
