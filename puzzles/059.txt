cave
a dark hole in the side of a hill
bats hang from the roof deep down
drips of wet form points of stone
it stays cool on the most hot days
old art was drawn on its rock walls
a stream may flow through its depths
you need a lamp to see in one
shout and the sound comes back twice
bears may den in one through the cold
step in and the light fades fast
