gorge
a deep steep cut in the rock made by a stream
look down from the rim and the drop is vast
the walls are sheer on both sides
a flow carved it out through the years
a bridge may span it at its most thin point
a hike down takes you past bands of old rock
a raft ride through one can be wild
mist hangs in the gap at dawn
it can mean to eat far too much at once
the roar of the falls fills the whole gap
