notch
a small cut or groove in a hard edge
carve one in a stick to keep a count
a belt has a row of them for size
a step up in rank or skill is one
it fits two parts so they lock in place
a gap in a ridge where the trail goes through
file one in the wood to join two beams
each win adds one to your score
a bow string sits in one at the tip
a key has small ones cut in its side
