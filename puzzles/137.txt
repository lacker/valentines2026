blaze
a wild hot spread of flames in the brush
it burns all in its wake to black
a bright mark on a trail guides the way
the heat of it can be felt from far off
crews fight to hold it back with lines
a horse may have a white one on its face
it roars as it eats through dry wood
ash and smoke fill the sky for miles
a spark in dry grass can start one
the glow of it lights the night sky red
