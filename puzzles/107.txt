marsh
a flat wet land of reeds and grass
the ground is soft and soaked through
birds wade in the still dull pools
a thick mist hangs low at dawn
frogs and bugs fill the air with sound
the mud sucks at your boots when you step
tall green stalks sway in the breeze
a duck or crane makes its home here
it floods when the rains come hard
the edge of land and sea can form one
