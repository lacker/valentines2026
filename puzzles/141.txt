sketch
a quick rough draft drawn with a pen
lines and strokes catch the shape fast
an art pad and a stick of lead is all you need
it is not the full piece just the first pass
shade the dark parts with cross hatched marks
an eye or hand takes shape in just a few strokes
a plan or blue print starts as one
rip the page out and start fresh
some are loose and some are tight and clean
a note book full of them shows how you think
