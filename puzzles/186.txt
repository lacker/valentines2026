latch
a small bar that holds a door or gate shut
lift it up and the door swings free
a click means it has caught
it is less strong than a full lock
a child can work one with a small hand
a hook type drops in a loop to hold
a screen door has a thin one on the side
close the gate and let it drop in place
fix one on the fence to keep the dog in
a loose one means the wind can blow it wide
