surf
ride the waves on a board near the shore
the white foam curls and breaks on the sand
a wet suit keeps you warm in the cold swell
stand up and glide on the crest of a wave
the roar of it fills the coast
a storm far off sends big ones to the beach
wax the board so your feet do not slip
a reef break sends the best ones up
the rush of it draws you back each day
salt spray stings your face as you ride
