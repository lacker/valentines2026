guilt
a bad feel you get when you do wrong
it weighs on your mind like a stone
a court finds you this or not
it eats at you till you say what you did
a look on your face may show it
it is the twin of shame in the gut
a clean heart has none of this
own up and the load of it lifts
some hide it but it shows through in time
a trip of it can change how you act
