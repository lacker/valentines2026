scalp
the skin on the top of your head
hair grows from it thick or thin
a bad sun burn makes it peel and flake
rub it and you feel the bone of your skull
a bald man shows his bare one to the world
it can itch when dry or stressed
a cut on one bleeds a lot
a hat shields it from the hot sun
scratch it when you try to think hard
wash it well to keep the roots clean
