sand
the beach is made of this fine grain
it gets in your shoes and hair
a dune of it forms in the wind
kids build forts and shapes from wet piles
it drains through a small glass to count time
the shore is a long strip of it
dig in it and find shells down deep
it stings your face in a dry gust
a vast stretch of it makes up the wastes
glass is made when you melt it down
