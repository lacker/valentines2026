coin
a small round disc of pressed ore
flip one to choose heads or tails
put some in a jar to save up
a dime or cent is one of these
clink them on a hard flat top
once they were made of real gold
a slot takes one to start a game
old rare ones are worth a lot
a mint stamps them out by the score
check your pouch for a spare one
