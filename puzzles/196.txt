stork
a tall white bird with long thin legs
it stands in the marsh and waits for fish
a folk tale says it brings new born babes
its beak is long and sharp and red
it builds a huge nest on top of a roof
it flies south when the cold months come
it wades through the low wet ground with slow steps
a pair of them will mate for life
it snaps up frogs from the edge of a pond
its wide wings spread out like a cape
