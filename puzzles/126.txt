stump
the short round base left when a tree is cut
sit on one in the woods and rest
an axe leaves one flat on top
count the rings on it to guess the age
it rots slow in the damp earth
a small one makes a step stool
pull one out with a chain and truck
new shoots may sprout from its sides
a hard quiz can leave you like one stuck in place
moss and bugs make a home on its flat top
