pond
a small still pool of fresh clean wet
frogs sit on the pad leaves and croak
a duck glides on its calm flat face
kids toss bread to the birds at its edge
it is less wide than a lake
a green film can grow on the top
gold fish swim in a yard one
a rock tossed in makes rings spread out
reeds and grass line its soft banks
drain it and just mud stays at the base
