ditch
a long thin trench dug in the ground
it runs by the side of the road
rain drains in and flows down its bed
dig one to move the wet from a field
a car can slide off in and get stuck
jump it to cross from one field to the next
some are dry and some are full of muck
a crew with spades digs one out each year
it can mean to drop or leave a thing fast
a moat is a wide deep form of one
