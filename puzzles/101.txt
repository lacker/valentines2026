wool
sheep give this soft thick stuff
shear the fleece and spin it to thread
a scarf or hat is knit from it
it keeps you warm in the cold months
it can itch if worn on bare skin
dye it bright or leave it white
a ball of it sits in a craft bag
a loom weaves it to cloth
it shrinks if washed in hot suds
the feel of it is soft but rough
