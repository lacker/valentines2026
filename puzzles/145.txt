tusk
a long curved tooth that juts from the mouth
an ox of the ice age had two huge ones
it is made of a white dense stuff
a boar or seal grows one on each side
the trade in them put beasts at risk
carve it to make art or tools
it grows through the whole life of the beast
poach one and the law comes down hard
a large grey beast in the south has the best known pair
they are used to dig and fight and strip bark
