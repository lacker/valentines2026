bell
it rings with a clear bright tone
a clap of its tongue makes the sound
a church has one in a tall spire
a school one tells you class has come
shake them at the end of the year
a chime of brass or bronze it is
one hangs from the neck of a cow
ring it loud to warn of a threat
a soft ding comes from a small one
a crack in it makes the tone go flat
