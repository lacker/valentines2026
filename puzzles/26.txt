bone
it is hard and white in your frame
the skull is one that guards your brain
dogs love to chew and gnaw on one
a break in one hurts a great deal
joints link where two of them meet
soft stuff fills the space in its core
an arm or leg has a long one
the spine is a stack of these
a doc can set one when it cracks
dry ones bleach white in the sun
