yeast
a small live thing that makes dough rise
add it to warm drink and it foams
it feeds on the sweet stuff and grows
bread needs it to puff up and get light
beer and wine use it to turn sweet to strong
a pinch of it goes in the mix
it works best in a warm spot
the dough swells to twice its size
bake shops keep a stock of it on hand
leave it too long and the taste goes off
