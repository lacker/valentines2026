forge
a place where hot ore gets shaped
a smith works here with tongs and a maul
the fire burns white hot in its pit
strike the red hot piece on a block
steel bends to a new form here
sparks fly as the blows rain down
it takes great skill and arm strength
cool the piece in a tub of brine
blades and tools come from this place
the ring of struck ore fills the air
