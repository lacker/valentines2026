knot
tie two ends and this is what forms
a loop pulled tight that holds things fast
a scout learns to make all kinds
it can be hard to work loose once set
a speed at sea is named for this
a wood board may have a round dark one
twist and pull to make one strong
the more you tug the more it grips
a bow is a type you tie on gifts
your gut gets one when you feel dread
