leash
clip it on to walk your dog
a strap or cord that keeps a pet close
tug it back when it pulls too far
the law says use one in the park
a short one keeps the dog at your side
let it out long so the dog can roam
wrap it round your wrist for a good grip
a pup must learn to walk on one
some are made of cloth and some of hide
snap it on the ring at the neck band
