ship
it sails on the sea from port to port
a hull and mast and deck make up its frame
the crew works hard to keep it on course
waves crash on its sides in rough seas
a flag flies high from its top
goods are moved far in its hold
it can sink if the hull gets a hole
a dock is where it ties up and rests
some are large and some are small boats
a horn blasts when it leaves the shore
