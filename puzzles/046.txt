spring
it comes each year when the cold breaks
buds bloom and birds sing once more
the ground thaws and streams start to flow
a coil of wire that can bounce and stretch
press it down and it pops back up
a leap or jump can be called this
fresh green growth fills the fields
a source of clean fresh ground flow
lambs are born and days grow long
rain comes oft in this mild time
