flute
blow through it to make a sweet sound
a long thin tube with holes for your hands
a high clear tone rings from its end
a band or group may have one
press the keys to change the note
it is one of the first kinds to be played
a bird song sounds like one at times
wood or steel can form its shaft
a soft piece played on one can calm the soul
breath and lip shape are the skills you need
