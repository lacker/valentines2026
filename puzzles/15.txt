bird
it has wings and a beak and can fly
plumes keep it warm and help it soar
it builds a nest from twigs and grass
some sing sweet songs at dawn
eggs hatch in the nest come spring
a hawk or wren or jay is one
it picks at seeds and worms for food
flocks move south when cold winds blow
a cage can hold a pet one
watch them glide on the warm breeze
