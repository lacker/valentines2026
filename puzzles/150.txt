prune
a dried plum that is dark and sweet
eat one to keep your gut in good shape
the skin folds up as it dries in the sun
stew them soft and spread on toast
the taste is rich and deep
a box of them sits in the snack aisle
it can mean to cut back a bush or tree
trim the dead limbs to help new growth
both a fruit and a thing you do with shears
old age can make skin look like one
