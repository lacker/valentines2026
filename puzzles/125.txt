cliff
a steep rock face that drops straight down
stand at its edge and look far out
waves crash at the base of a sea one
do not lean too close to the brink
a nest of gulls clings to its ledge
a goat can climb up its rough face
the view from the top takes your breath
a fall from it would be the end
wind howls up the sheer stone wall
a rope helps you scale one from the base
