fire
it burns and gives off heat
red and gold flames dance and glow
logs and coal can feed this thing
smoke floats up from where it sits
camps need one when night is cold
a match or spark can start one
it can spread through dry grass fast
warmth comes from its bright hot light
ash is left when it dies out
put it out or it may spread
