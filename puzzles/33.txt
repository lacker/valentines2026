steel
ore and heat forge this strong stuff
beams of it hold up tall builds
a blade or tool is shaped from it
it gleams when you buff it smooth
rust eats at it in the damp air
a mill makes great sheets and bars
trains run on rails of it
a tank of war is clad in thick plates
it bends but it does not snap with ease
weld two parts to join them tight
