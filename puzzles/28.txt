light
flip a switch and the room fills with it
the sun gives off the most of it
dark is what you get with none
a lamp or torch shines it for you
it moves so fast that naught beats it
plants need it to grow and thrive
a beam of it cuts through the fog
white can split to show all the hues
a flash of it comes with a storm
close your eyes and it goes dim
