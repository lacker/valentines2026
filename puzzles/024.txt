heart
it beats in your chest all day
love is linked to its red shape
pump pump pump goes the life force
veins and blood flow from this core
when scared it pounds real fast
a doc can hear it with a scope
give one on a card for those you love
it breaks when loss or grief hits hard
some say to trust your gut but some say trust this
a strong one keeps you well
