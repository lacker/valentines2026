quill
a long stiff plume used as a pen
dip it in ink and write on the page
it comes from the wing of a bird
the tip is cut to a sharp point
scribes used one in the old days
the scratch of it on a page was the sound of thought
a goose gave the best ones they say
it bends a bit as you press down
a pot of ink sits near it on the desk
words on a scroll were set down with this tool
