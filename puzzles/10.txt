star
it shines at night up in the sky
the sun is the one close to earth
some form shapes that we call signs
a wish is made when one streaks by
they burn with gas and light for years
look through a scope to see them well
the north one guides you when you are lost
five points make the shape we draw
some are dim and some blaze bright
a clear dark night shows the most
