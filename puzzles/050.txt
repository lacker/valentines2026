fox
it creeps through the woods at dusk
red fur and a long thick tail
it digs a hole to raise its young
quick and sly is how tales paint it
a hen house is its prime mark
it howls and barks in the night air
keen ears pick up sounds from far off
a hound may chase one through the fields
it eats mice and fruit and scraps
small and lean with a sharp thin face
