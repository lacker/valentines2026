clock
it tells you what time it is
hands move round a face with marks
tick tick goes the sound it makes
set a wake up call on one
a tall stone spire may hold a big one
wind it up or put in a cell
the hours pass as its hands turn
a small carved bird pops out of one kind
it hangs on a wall or sits on a shelf
when its hands point up it is noon
