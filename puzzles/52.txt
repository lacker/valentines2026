map
lines and shapes show the land on it
use one to find your way when lost
a road or trail is drawn on it
north is at the top by rule
fold it up to fit in your pack
the scale tells how far things are
a key on it shows what the marks mean
seas and coasts are drawn in blue
peaks have tight rings to show their height
spread it flat on a desk to plan your route
