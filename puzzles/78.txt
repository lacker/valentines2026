silk
a smooth soft cloth that shines and drapes
worms spin this from a fine thread
a tie or scarf made of it feels rich
it costs more than most plain cloth
the touch of it slides on your skin
a robe of it flows like a stream
it comes in bold and soft hues
a bride may wear a gown of it
strong for how thin and light it is
the trade of it linked east to west long back
