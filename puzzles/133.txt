shrine
a small place built to show thanks or faith
a light or flame burns at its base
gifts and blooms are left in front of it
it may hold a blessed thing of old
some are built on a hill or in the woods
those who pray may walk far to reach one
it is a spot of peace and calm
a prayer is said at the foot of one
the walls may show art of the saints
a bell or gong rings near its gate
