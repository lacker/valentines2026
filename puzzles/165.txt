broth
a thin warm soup made from bones and meat
sip it slow from a cup or bowl
it is the base of most good soups
cook it for hours to draw out the taste
salt and herbs give it the right note
strain it clear through a fine mesh
it warms you through on a sick day
a stock pot on the stove holds it
it can be made from fowl or beef or greens
the smell of it fills the whole house
