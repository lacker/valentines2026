drum
you hit it with sticks to make a beat
a skin stretched tight on a round frame
a band needs one to keep the time
a march starts with the roll of one
it booms when struck with force
tap it soft for a light pulse
some use hands and not sticks to play
tribes would pound them round a blaze
a snare type has a crisp sharp sound
the thump of one can shake your chest
