king
he rules the land from a throne
a crown of gold sits on his head
a queen stands by his side
knights serve and guard his realm
he holds great force and wealth
a prince is next in line to be one
a court of lords does his will
wars were fought at his word
a grand stone fort is where he dwells
chess has one that must not fall
