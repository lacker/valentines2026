salt
a white grain used to add taste
the sea is full of it
shake some on your food at meals
too much is bad for your health
roads get a spread of it when ice forms
it has been prized since old times
a mine deep down holds large seams of it
it dries and cures meat to keep it fresh
tears and sweat both have this in them
a pinch of it goes a long way
