plow
a blade on a frame that turns the soil
it rips through the field in long straight rows
a horse or ox once pulled one
hitch it to the back of a truck
push the dirt to the side of the road
a farm needs one to prep the ground for seed
the steel edge cuts through hard packed earth
it clears the snow off the streets in a storm
a long straight trench trails in its wake
spring means time to bring one out and start
