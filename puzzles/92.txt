smoke
it curls up from a blaze in grey clouds
breathe it in and your lungs burn
a stack or flue lets it out of a house
a trail of it marks where the flames are
some meats are cured in thick clouds of it
your eyes sting and your throat gets raw
a screen of it hides what lies past
it curls and twists as it floats up
the smell of it clings to your clothes
where there is this there is bound to be blaze
