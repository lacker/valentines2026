squid
a sea beast with long arms and a soft form
it shoots ink to hide from those that hunt it
its arms grab fish and pull them to its beak
some grow as large as a boat
chop it up and fry it in rings
it swims by push of a jet of sea
its eyes are large and round like a plate
the flesh is white and firm when cooked
it can change its hue in a flash
deep dark depths are where the big ones live
